          always a greater or less degree of vagueness. The meaning is an area,
          like a target : it may have a bull's eye, but the outlying parts of
          the target are still more or less within the meaning, in a gradually
          diminishing degree as we travel further from the bull's eye. As
          language grows more precise, there is less and less of the target
          outside the bull's eye, and the bull's eye itself grows smaller and
          smaller; but the bull's eye never shrinks to a point, and there is
          always a doubtful region, however small, surrounding it.

            On the understanding of words, a very admirable little book is
            Ribot's Evolution of General Ideas, Open Court Co., 1899. Ribot says
            (p. 131) : <q type="written">"We learn to understand a concept as we
            learn to walk, dance, fence or play a musical instrument: it is a
            habit, i.e. an organized memory.  General terms cover an
            organized, latent knowledge which is the hidden capital without
            which we should be in a state of bankruptcy, manipulating false
            money or paper of no value. General ideas are habits in the
            intellectual order."</q>

        <p>
          A word is used <soCalled>" correctly "</soCalled> when the average
          hearer will be affected by it in the way intended. This is a
          psychological, not a literary, of <soCalled>"correctness."</soCalled>
          The literary definition would substitute, for the average hearer, a
          person of high education living a long time ago; the purpose of this
          definition is to make it difficult to speak or write correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The relation of a word to its meaning is of the nature of a causal law
          governing our use of the word and our actions when we hear it used.
          There is no more reason why a person who uses a word correctly should
          be able to tell what it means than there is why a planet which is
          moving correctly should know Kepler's laws.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          To illustrate what is meant by <soCalled> "understanding"</soCalled>
          words and sentences, let us take instances of various situations.
        </p> 

        <pb n="199"/> 

        <p>
          Suppose you are walking in London with an absent-minded friend, and
          while crossing a street you say, <q type="spoken">"Look out, there's a
          motor coming."</q> He will glance round and jump aside without the
          need of any<soCalled> " mental "</soCalled> intermediary. There need
          be no <soCalled>"ideas,"</soCalled> but only a stiffening of the
          muscles, followed quickly by action.  He <soCalled>"understands
          "</soCalled> the words, because he does the right thing. Such
          <soCalled>"understanding "</soCalled> may be taken to belong to the
          nerves and brain, being habits which they have acquired while the
          language was being learnt. Thus understanding in this sense may be
          reduced to mere physiological causal laws.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          If you say the same thing to a Frenchman with a slight knowledge of
          English he will go through some inner speech which may be represented
          by <q type="thought">"Que dit-il ?  Ah, oui, une automobile !"</q>
          After this, the rest follows as with the Englishman.  Watson would
          contend that the inner speech must be incipiently pronounced; we
          should argue that it might be merely imaged. But this point is not
          important in the present connection.
        </p>

        <p>If you say the same thing to a child who does not yet know the word
          <term>"motor,"</term> but does know the other words you are using, you
          produce a feeling of anxiety and doubt: you will have to point and
          say, <q type="spoken">"There, that's a motor."</q> After that the
          child will roughly understand the word <term>"motor,"</term> though he
          may include trains and steam-rollers If this is the first time the
          child has heard the word <term>"motor,"</term> he may for a long time
          continue to recall this scene when he hears the word.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far we have found four ways of understanding words:
          <list type="numbered"> 
           <item>(1) On suitable occasions you use the word properly.</item> 
           <item>(2) When you hear it you act appropriately</item>
          </list>
        </p>

        <pb n="200"/> 

        <p>
          <list type="numbered">
            <item>(3) You associate the word with another word (say in a
            different language) which has the appropriate effect on
            behaviour.</item> 
            <item>(4) When the word is being first learnt, you may associate it
            with an object, which is what it <soCalled>" means"</soCalled> or
            a representative of various objects that it
            <soCalled>"means."</soCalled></item>
          </list>
